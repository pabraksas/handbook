## Enrolling in Benefits

If you have existing coverage when joining GitLab (e.g. coverage for an additional month from your prior employer), you have the option of enrolling in GitLab's coverage after your prior coverage terminates. If you wish to do this, you should register with PlanSource during onboarding and waive all coverages. Once your previous coverage is terminated, you should sign up for coverage through PlanSource on or within 30 days of the termination date by initiating a Qualifying Life Event and providing proof of coverage termination.

**If you do not enroll in a plan within your benefits election period, you will automatically be enrolled in the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).**

More information on the processed deductions in payroll from PlanSource can be found on the [Accounting and Reporting page](/handbook/finance/accounting/).

For questions on benefits, please see the following [PlanSource Video Library](https://videolibrary.plansource.com/).

#### Eligibility

Any active, regular, full-time team member working a minimum of 30 hours per week are eligible for all benefits. Benefits are effective on your date of hire. Others eligible for benefits include:

- Your legal spouse or domestic partner,
- Your dependent children up until age 26 (including legally adopted and stepchildren), and/or
- Any dependent child who reaches the limiting age and is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability

Note: If you and an eligible dependent (as defined above) are both employed by GitLab, you may only be covered by GitLab’s coverage once. This also applies to enrolling in either your own supplemental life insurance or supplemental spouse/dependent life insurance through your dependent who is employed by GitLab, but not both.

A domestic partnership is an arrangement in which two people live together and are in a committed relationship without being legally married. Domestic partnerships are composed of two people of any gender, which includes male, female, or nonbinary people. If you have recently entered in to a Domestic Partnership, or your Domestic Partner goes through a Qualifying Life Event, you may add them to the GitLab plans as outlined in the instructions below. During the documentation step, you will be asked to fill out and submit a [Domestic Partner Affidavit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11cV-WXJXu8G626muav2aJvpYS4CMleeE/view?usp=sharing) in to PlanSource. If you are adding your Domestic Partner during New Hire Enrollment or Open Enrollment, there is no need to fill out the Domestic Partnership Affidavit.

#### Qualifying Life Events

Due to IRS guidelines, you cannot make changes to your health insurance benefits outside of GitLab's annual open enrollment period unless you experience a [Qualifying Life Event](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/).

A QLE is a change in your situation — like getting married, having a baby, etc that can make you eligible for a special enrollment period. You must wait until the event date has passed to submit your Qualifying Life Event. You have ***30 days from the date of your qualifying event*** to submit your requested change to PlanSource.

Cigna has advised they will provide [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/) compliant coverage for all plans. For more information on their coverage, please see the [coverage policy document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdsiFcTFEWsIidOXwPBcNNOCqFVERSXg/view?usp=sharing). For Cigna to provide coverage, medical necessity must be proven. It is highly recommended to go through the prior authorization process when seeking treatment.

Please reach out to the [Total Rewards team and WTW]({{< ref "inc-benefits-us#who-to-contact" >}}) with any questions or if you need help while seeking authorization for a treatment.

##### Cigna Provider Search

1. Visit [myCigna](https://my.cigna.com/web/public/guest). If you haven't previously registered for an account, you will want to register.
1. Select "Find Care & Costs" at the top of the page.
1. Here you can select to search by Doctor Type, Name, Reason for Visit, Facility, or you can price a medication at local pharmacies.
1. When you scroll down, there are quick links for your nearest urgent care and telehealth.

Potential joiners who do not have a myCigna account yet can search for providers on the [Cigna Website](https://hcpdirectory.cigna.com/web/public/consumer/directory/plan-selection). When selecting a plan everyone at GitLab (PPO, EPO, and HDHP members) will use the OPEN ACCESS PLUS selection, except for Utah members, who will use the PPO option.

Team Members and potential joiners can also reach out to the [Cigna One Guide service](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIvtYtYPSt3Q0h-Byd16CFFfT0bxv8yF/view?usp=sharing) to check if their doctors are in-network and walk through the GitLab plans with a Cigna rep.


{{% alert title="Important Note" color="warning" %}}
As an additional measure to confirm “Contracted Providers” (i.e. In-Network), it’s always a good idea to follow up with Providers directly (phone, email or otherwise) to additionally confirm if a Provider is contracted with Cigna or not and if the type of service is covered. In some instances, the same provider may be covered In-Network for certain types of services, but may be Out-Network for other services.
Provider contracts change and sometimes the contracts change faster than the website maintenance teams for the insurance carriers. It's better to spend time researching and confirming rather than assuming and being stuck with *balance billing* from Out of Network providers.
*Balance billing* is if the Out of Network provider's charge is $100 and the carrier’s maximum allowed reimbursement (MAR) amount is $70, the provider is within rights to bill you for the remaining $30. A “Cigna Contracted Provider” cannot balance bill Cigna members.

### 401(k) Match

GitLab offers matching 50% of contributions on the first 6% of allocated gross earnings per pay period with a yearly cap of $1,500 USD. If a hypothetical team member's salary is $50,000 USD, their gross pay per period is $50,000 / 24 = $2083.33. This is then matched at a rate of $2083.33 \* 6% \* 50% = $62.50.

As of 1 August, 2022 GitLab has removed the vesting schedule for the employer match. All prior employer match amounts have fully vested as of 1 August, 2022, new employer match contributions will automatically vest when received.

As you are eligible to participate in GitLab's 401k as of your hire date, you are *also* eligible for GitLab matching contributions as of your hire date.

All employer contributions are pre-tax contributions. Team members can still make Roth 401(k) team member contributions and receive pre-tax employer contributions to your Traditional 401(k) account.

**Administration of the 401(k) Match:**

- The employer will use the calculation on each check date effective as of January 1, 2019.
- The team member must have a contribution for a check date to be eligible for the employer match.
- Employer matching will be released into participant accounts three business days after the check date.
- For team members who defer more than 6% on each check date, an annual true-up will be conducted after calendar year end.
- The 401(k) match runs calendar year.

## Optional Plans Available at Team Member Expense

### WEX (Discovery Benefits) Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts

If you are enrolled in a Health Savings Account (HSA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA) or commuter benefits, the funds are held through WEX (Discovery Benefits). After your benefit enrollment effective start date, [create an account with WEX (Discovery)](https://benefitslogin.wexhealth.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) to manage your funds. You will only receive one debit card upon enrollment. To obtain a second card (for a dependent, etc.) you will need to login to your account on WEX (Discovery) or call and they will send one to your home of record.

#### Health Savings Account (HSA)

GitLab contributes $100 per month for those enrolled in the HSA under Individual cover, and $125 per month under team member + dependent(s) cover. You must be enrolled in the HDHP plan in order to contribute to the HSA.

##### Benefits of an HSA account

Your HSA account allows you to set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. By using untaxed dollars in an HSA to pay for deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and some other expenses, you may be able to lower your out-of-pocket health care costs. Some benefits of on HSA account are:

Your HSA contributions go into your account before taxes. The money you save to your HSA lowers your taxable income – so you may pay less in taxes.
Money in your HSA account earns tax-free interest.
Any unused HSA funds roll over to the next year.  The money is yours forever. It doesn’t expire.
You can spend your HSA dollars on eligible health care expenses, or save and invest them for the future.
Once your HSA account hits a certain balance, you can invest a portion of your HSA balance in mutual funds, stocks and bonds.
You can use your HSA to save for retirement. At age 65, you can use the funds for any purpose without a penalty. The money you take out to pay for eligible health care expenses continues to be tax free. You also can take money out for other reasons without paying a penalty.

##### HSA Account Rollover & Administration

If you would like to transfer your HSA from a previous account, please contact WEX (Discovery) and request a HSA Transfer funds form. On the form you will put your old HSA provider’s account number and any other required personal information. You will then submit the form to WEX (Discovery), and they will get in contact with your old HSA provider and process the transfer of funds. You can reach WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or `customerservice@discoverybenefits.com`.

If you would like to adjust your HSA contributions please log into [PlanSource](https://benefits.plansource.com/).

HSAs roll over completely year-to-year and are 'owned' by the team member. If you leave GitLab and would like to keep your HSA account, GitLab will no longer be responsible for the administration fee. The account holder will become responsible for the $2.50 per month admin fee.

Domestic Partner Reimbursements: If the team member is not legally married to their domestic partner, the domestic partner's expenses are not eligible for disbursement from the HSA. However, if the domestic partner is covered under the family HDHP through the team member, the domestic partner can open their own HSA and contribute up to the full family contribution maximum. The team member may also contribute up to the full family contribution maximum to their own HSA.

#### Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Plans ()

FSAs help you pay for eligible out-of-pocket health care and dependent day care expenses on a pretax basis. You determine your projected expenses for the Plan Year and then elect to set aside a portion of each paycheck into your FSA. FSA contributions can only be updated during open enrollment or through a [qualifying life event (QLE)](#qualifying-life-events).

There are three types of FSAs that team members may enroll in:
- Medical FSA: Lets you pay for all eligible medical expenses, including dental and vision expenses, as well as over-the-counter medications. Team Members who have an HSA cannot participate in a medical FSA.
- Dependent Care FSA: restrict eligible expenses to dependent care expenses exclusively. A qualifying ‘dependent’ may be a child under age 13, a disabled spouse, or an older parent in eldercare.
- Limited Purpose FSA: restrict eligible expenses to dental and vision expenses exclusively. Team members with an HSA can participate in a limited purpose FSA.

 Per WEX Health, FSA rollover funds are not available for 2024 expenses until 5-15 business days after 2024-03-31 (should be no later than 2024-04-22).

In 2023 the maximum salary deferral contribution has increased to $3,050 USD, with the maximum rollover amount increasing to $610 USD.

In 2024 the maximum salary deferral contribution has increased to $3,200 USD, with the maximum rollover amount increasing to $$640 USD.

FSAs are employer-owned accounts. If you leave GitLab, your Medical FSA account will be terminated on your date of termination unless you continue this through COBRA. You are able to use your full FSA amounts up to and on your last day, but not afterwards unless you enroll into COBRA. WEX (Discovery) asks that all claims be submitted up to 90 days after termination date. You can enroll into COBRA FSA if you have spent less out of your account than you have contributed to it. If you decide to enroll, you will be required to continue making your monthly contributions on a post-tax status.  For additional information, please reach out to WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or `customerservice@discoverybenefits.com`. Dependent Care FSAs cannot be continued via COBRA.

FSAs (and Dependent Care FSAs) are subject to annual testing by the Internal Revenue Code guidelines to ensure the pre-tax benefits do not disproportionately benefit highly compensated employees. At the end of each plan year, GitLab will work with WTW to conduct the nondiscrimination testing. If a test returns that highly compensated employees benefit, you may not be able to pre-tax the full amount of your election. This can vary each year and is based upon the dollar amount of non-highly compensated employees’ elections.

##### FSA Period to Submit Claims

Up to 90 days after the plan year has concluded (also known as the runout period).


#### Commuter Benefits

GitLab offers [commuter benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPek1Ia0ZqYjhuT25zYjdYTUpiS1NFSXFXc0Vn/view?usp=sharing) which are administered through WEX (Discovery Benefits).

In 2023 the contribution limits are $300/month for parking and $300 per month of transit. These contributions rollover month to month.

We will post the update contributions for 2024 once the IRS publishes them.

##### Commuter Benefits Period to Submit Claims

For active employees: Up to 180 days after plan year has concluded (also known as the runout period).

For terminated employees: Up to 90 days after the termination date.
