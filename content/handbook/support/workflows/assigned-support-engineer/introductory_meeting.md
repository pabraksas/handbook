description: Purpose, structure and goals of an introductory meeting between an ASE and their account, and tips for how to make the meeting successful

## Overview and Purpose

When a customer account signs their first contract for a GitLab Assigned
Support Engineer (ASE), we need to be prepared to start delivering the service
on day one of the contract. But what exactly are we delivering? Even with the
terms being spelled out in the signed Statement of Work (SOW), we can't really
answer that question until we meet with the customer to tell them who we are,
learn who they are, learn how and why they use GitLab, and learn their reasons
for signing that contract.

With that purpose in mind, the ASE and their manager should work with the
account team to schedule an hour-long introductory meeting with key members of
the customer's team to occur on the first business day of the SOW. If the ASE or
the customer is not available on that day, schedule the meeting for no more
than five business days later.

## Goals

There are only a few goals for this meeting:

- Gain a shared understanding of how you and the customers will and won't work
  together
- Begin the relationship building between you and the customers
- Learn what the customers really want and need from you

## Tips

1. State clearly to the account team when the meeting is being scheduled that
   the ASE will run the meeting and that they will use the entire meeting for
   their set agenda.
1. For the meeting to be successful, these people must participate:
   1. The customer's technical people who are expected to be the ones working
      with the ASE on a frequent basis
   1. The person on the customer's team who will be monitoring and measuring
      the success of the ASE engagement
   1. The ASE
1. Do **not** let the meeting become a troubleshooting session
1. Throughout the meeting, be sure that you speak clearly, slowly but not too
   slowly, and loudly enough but not too loudly - your aim is to be heard and
   understood the first time
1. Be yourself, gently: let the customers get to know you a little at a time
1. Be friendly and happy, and let the customers feel your energy and
   excitement around this opportunity
1. Be **early** to the meeting, and welcome each person as they join
1. This meeting is your first opportunity to set expectations with the customer,
   so let them see how we, and you, operate: stay on your agenda, keep the meeting
   flowing, be sure somebody is taking good notes, and end the meeting on time
