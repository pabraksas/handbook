Zendesk US Federal has some similar apps as Zendesk Global. The ones they have

- [Out of Office](./global-apps#out-of-office)

### Architecture Diagrams

<sup>*Introduced via [support-ops-project#801](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-ops-project/-/issues/801)*</sup>

This app uses the Organization field `AM Project ID` to check for an existing
Account Management project. If it finds it, it will then link to that
projectâ€™s Architecture Diagram.

**NOTE**: The AM Project ID field is manually populated. To get that added in,
you would want to submit a Support Ops Project issue.

### Due Date Picker

This is a GitLab built app that allows you to customize what the Due Date for a
Task ticket is set for. By default, Zendesk only allows setting the date. This
enables you to set the date, time, and timezone.
