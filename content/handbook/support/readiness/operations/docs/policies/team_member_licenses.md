<sup>*Introduced via [support-team-meta#3335](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/3335)*</sup>

## The process

The process for these is:

1. The GitLab team member submits a request via the
   [Support Super Form](https://support-super-form-gitlab-com-support-support-op-651f22e90ce6d7.gitlab.io/).
1. If valid, an issue is filed in
   [support-ops-project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-ops-project).
1. Support Operations logs into the
   [staging cDot app](https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admin/license/new_license)
   and confirms there is not an already existing license.
1. Support Operations generates the license using the parameters in the issue.
1. Support Operations updates the issue and closes it out.

#### Checking for an existing license

1. Login to the
   [staging cDot app](https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admins/sign_in) via
   Okta.
1. Click the [Licenses](https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admin/license) link
   on the left-hand side of the page.
1. Type the email address in the search box and click `Refresh`.
1. Review the results to see if an existing license (that is not expired) exists
   can still be utilized.
1. If one does exist, please ask for clarification why a new license is needed
   when an existing one can be used still.
1. Review the clarification given and make a decision if a new license is
   warranted.

#### Creating a license

**Note** Before proceeding, please confirm the requested end date on the issue
does not exceed 1 year. If it does, we cannot proceed with the request until
the requester changes that.
