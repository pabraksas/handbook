## <i class="far fa-newspaper" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Charter

Data Intelligence (DI) is a part of Field Operations reporting to Revenue Operations. Our goal is to ensure the field has reliable and quality Salesforce.com sales data to empower them to make repeatable and structured decisions to increase sales and make GitLab more successful. We aim to manage data well and be viewed as a trusted business partner for Sales Operations, Marketing Operations, and Management.

Data intelligence aims at ensuring that impacted parties understand the data and the best uses of the data. This is achieved through enablement to the field on data enrichment, data governance, data cleaning, and overall fostering a data culture to make data-driven decisions and drive results.

Our Data Governance page can be found [here](/handbook/sales/field-operations/data-intelligence/data-governance/)

**Slack channels**

We do not use or create tool-specific Slack channels (e.g. `#zoominfo`).

- [#dataintelligencehelp](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/dataintelligencehelp) - We use this channel for general data intelligence support. We attempt to [avoid direct messages](/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages) where possible as it discourages collaboration.

### Focus Fridays

[Focus Fridays](/handbook/communication/#focus-fridays). Please try not to schedule meetings for team members on Fridays, so they can devote time for deep work in milestone-related issues.
