## CS Ops Request Process

### Process Flow

Instructions for new request intake and execution for following along with the flowchart above (definitions further down on the page). Once assigned, the Issue Assignee moves the issue through each label.

- Workstream Lead: the individual who has oversight for a given topic, product, or section (e.g., Digital, Gainsight, Scale, ROPS)
- Issue Assignee: the assignee for the issue who will execute and will own the issue through to completion

1. **New Request** only has ~CSOps label - The Workstream Lead (Gainsight, Scale, Digital, ROPS, etc.) will review requests on a weekly basis to assign, mark as Need more info, mark as won't do, transfer them to a different team, or defer to a later date
1. **CSOps::Triage** - The Workstream Lead will move the issue here when after review and ready for prioritization
1. **CSOps::Monitoring** - Apply this label for issues that have been transferred to another team ex: systems, SOPS, etc or when CSOps opens an issue for completion by another team and would like to monitor progress on said issue to completion
1. **CSOps::Need_More_Info** - Issue Assignee to apply label if additional information or clarity is needed from the business stakeholder
1. **CSOps::Unassigned** - Workstream Lead to apply the label when we've agreed the work should be done, but lack prioritization and/or capacity
1. **CSOps::In Process** - Issue Assignee is actively working the issue; if you are working an issue, it must have this label
1. **CSOps::Awaiting Feedback** - Issue Assignee to add Peer Reviewer and add label
1. **CSOps::Blocked** - Issue Assignee applies the label when the issue cannot be worked (technical problem or decision to be made)
1. **CSOps::Won’t Do** - Workstream Lead selects this when the decision has been made that it will not be worked, then close the issue
1. **CSOps::Backlog** - Workstream Lead applies label when we've agreed it's helpful and reasonable, but is either a lower priority or cannot achieve in the next 90 days
1. **Issue closing** - Issue Assignee to:
   1. Ensure any handbook sections have been updated
   1. Add to the Gainsight changelog
   1. Ensure the peer review process has been followed
   1. Communicate with stakeholders (in the issue, and possibly using other mediums such as Slack or a team call) as the last step, ensuring awareness and follow-through of the completion of the request
   1. Ensure the Workstream Lead is made aware, along with a summary of the work and any next steps
   1. Issue Assignee to add the `CSOps::Completed` label
   1. Close the issue!

## CS Ops Board, Groups, Projects, and Labels

### CS Operations Board

The CS Ops team uses issues and issue boards to track our projects and tasks. If you need help with a project, please open an issue and add the ~CSOps label anywhere within the GitLab repo.

CS Operations uses a [global issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/3156857?label_name[]=CSOps) to capture and track issues in any group or sub-group in the repo.

See the [global issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/customer-success-operations/-/boards/4341765?label_name[]=CS%20Ops%20Technical%20Writing) for CS Ops Technical Writing.

### Groups

- Use the `gitlab.com` group for epics that may include issues within and outside the Sales Team group.
- Use the GitLab Sales Team group for epics that may include issues within and outside the Field Operations group.

### Projects

Create issues in the [CS Operations project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/customer-success-operations).

### Issue Weighting

- Weight = 1: 0-1 hours of work
- Weight = 3: 1-3 hours of work
- Weight = 5: 3-5 hours of work
- Weight = 7: 5-7 hours of work

Anything that takes longer than a day of work should be captured in an epic/multiple issues

## Peer Review

The peer review process (currently for issues related to Gainsight) allows CS Ops team members to have another member of the team review their work.

The issue owner is responsible for making sure the issue is completed in timely manner, including communicating to the peer reviewer when the issue needs to be completed. The peer reviewer is responsible for completing the review in the timeframe given by the issue owner.

- Issues **MUST** be peer reviewed by the Gainsight Admin if it is a change, addition, or removal in a rule or data object (e.g. creating a new rule or connector job, removing fields from an object, combining multiple rules into one)
- For changes to reports or dashboards, strongly consider a peer review.

Feel free to ask for a peer review for other any updates if you feel it would be helpful to have a second opinion.

To start the peer review process:
1. Provide a Summary of the work you have completed in the **Resolution** section on the GitLab issue
2. Change the issue status to `CS Ops::Awaiting Feedback`
3. Tag the teammate completing the peer review and comment on the issue that it is ready for peer review
4. The issue owner will remain an assignee as they are ultimately responsible for the issue completion.
