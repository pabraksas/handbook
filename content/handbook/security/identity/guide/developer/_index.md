description: "The Identity Platform is a series of open source tools and reference architecture (paved roads) that the Identity Engineering team has created. We believe that everyone can contribute and help us add more business value, user experience quality of life improvements, and security best practices. This page provides a quick reference guide and runbooks for how internal team members can contribute to the platform and provides an orientation of all the components within the Identity Platform.
