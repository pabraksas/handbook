## Overview

The Security Identity Engineering team was formed on 2023-12-01 to lead the design and implementation of our next-generation of identity and access management framework and program at GitLab that we refer to as [Identity v3](/handbook/security/identity). The founding members of the team joined Security from the IT Engineering and IT Infrastructure team as part of an organization realignment, however have been working on identity management projects for several years.

To get started with understanding the Identity function, see the [Identity](/handbook/security/identity) handbook page. Our flagship project is the [Identity Platform](/handbook/security/identity/platform), powered by [Access Control (accessctl)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-identity/accessctl) and [Access Check (accesschk)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-identity/accesschk).

The team is just getting started, so please see the [Identity Engineering Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/identity/eng/issue-tracker/-/issues) to learn more about what we're working on.

**Looking for IT Infrastructure?** Please create an issue in the [Identity Ops Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/identity/ops/issue-tracker) or ask in Slack `#security-identity-ops`.
