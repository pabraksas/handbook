There are many types of survey questions to choose from when designing your survey.  Determining which kind of survey question to choose to use depends on the data you need to collect. Below are some of the more common survey question types that we use at GitLab.


- **Open ended** - Typically a comment box or a single line where respondents can type in responses.
     - Best for: qualitative data such as providing feedback
     - Things to watch for: don’t use too many of these types of questions, time-consuming to analyze, participants tend to skip them and/or leave limited detail

- **Multiple choice** - Offers respondents one or more options to choose from. Intuitive for respondents to complete. Can also be used with images as choices.
     - Best for: you have informed data to support the options, the options are distinct
     - Things to watch for: offering too many choices

- **Rating scale** - Allows the respondent to select a number as their response.
     - Best for: research questions that require numerical measures as data (example: scores, ratings, etc.)
     - Things to watch for: the scale needs to be defined (example: if the scale is ‘1-5’…define what 1 and 5 mean)

- [**Likert scale**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/rating-scales/) - A type of a rating scale question that lets respondents choose words/phrases that align with their feelings.
     - Best for: measuring feelings, attitudes, or opinions
     - Things to watch for: the scale needs to be balanced (has an equal number of positive and negative items)

- **Matrix** - A set of questions that all have the same scale and are presented as a grid.  Often used in conjunction with Rating scale or Likert scale questions.
     - Best for: consolidating questions that have the same scale into an efficient experience
     - Things to watch for: presenting too many questions in the matrix, keeping the scale the same, making sure the questions are clear and related

- **Ranking** - Allows respondents to rank a list of items, typically by preference.
     - Best for: understanding how users rank certain items in relation to other items (example: ranking possible features to build)
     - Things to watch for: offering too many items to rank (very common) which can impact how much time it takes respondents to rank items, making sure respondents understand each item clearly (can be accomplished by [piloting the survey first](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/surveys/piloting-your-survey/).
