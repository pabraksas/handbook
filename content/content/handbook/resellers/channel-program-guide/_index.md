## GitLab Channel Partner Program & Guide


### How the Program Works

Partner Program Tracks &  Designations

The GitLab Partner Program consists of two tracks to support the different ways our partners go to market:



- Open – This track is for all partners (resellers, integrators, sales, and services) in the DevOps space , IT as a service (ITaaS) and other adjacent spaces that are committed to investing in their DevOps practice buildout. GitLab Open partners may or may not be transacting partners, and qualifying partners can earn product discounts, referral fees and services incentives.
- Select – In this track, partners make a greater investment in GitLab sales expertise develop services practices around GitLab, and are expected to drive greater GitLab product recurring revenues. In return, Select partners have a dedicated Channel Account Manager (CAM) and greater investment. The Select track is by invitation only.
- Professional Services Partner (PSP) - this partner designation highlights your team’s capabilities in helping customers get up and running with GitLab as well as maximizing those customers’ ROI in GitLab.

### GitLab Partner Services Program

The GitLab Channel Services program is designed to help new or existing partners design service portfolios around the DevSecOps Lifecycle in correlation to GitLab products. The program helps partners evaluate business opportunities and creates a technical enablement framework to use as they build their GitLab-related service practices.

The foundation of the GitLab Partner Services Program consists of two elements on which partners can build upon to start or grow their GitLab-related service portfolio:



1. [Designations](/handbook/resellers/Channel-Program-Guide): GitLab offers the GitLab Professional Services Partner Designation (PSP), which includes training for service delivery teams which enable partners to meet program compliance requirements.
2. [GitLab Service Development Framework](/handbook/resellers/services/): Partners can utilize GitLab Service Development Framework to assist their teams as they build the service offerings, market and sell their services, and support their service business growth.


#### Becoming a Designated GitLab Professional Services Partner (PSP)

GitLab Professional Services Partner Designation (PSP) has partner program, competency, and delivery requirements that must be completed before you can obtain the designation. PSP designations will be awarded on a monthly basis to partners who complete the requirements below.

The GitLab Partner team will communicate new PSP designations in email, and reflect the designation in the GitLab Partner Locator.

GitLab PSP Designations are reviewed annually: <br>1\.Non-compliant partners at the time of the annual review will have their designations removed. <br>2\.Partners who received their PSP designation prior to Nov. 2023 will have until their next annual audit to become compliant with the new criteria. <br>3\.The annual audits are monthly, and will begin during Q1FY25 (Feb. 2024-Apr. 2024). <br>4\.Service delivery requirement will be prorated for the period between Nov. 2023-Nov. 2024.

#### Maintaining PSP Designation

GitLab Partner program will review the GitLab Professional Service Partners’ service attach registrations and practitioner certification status each year in the month the partner was originally granted certification. Partners will be notified with the outcome of the review and the resulting status of their designation via email. If partners are not compliant at their annual review date the GitLab Partner program team will remove the PSP designation in the GitLab Partner Portal profile. Partners can work with their GitLab Channel Account Manager (CAM) to create a plan for obtaining and maintaining designation.
