title: Growth and Development Fund
description: A description of programs and resources for team members to access when using the Growth and Development Fund.
---

## Introduction

At GitLab, team members have access to the [Growth and Development Fund](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit) to access external resources to develop their career.

GitLab team-members are eligible for a reimbursement of up to $10,000 USD per calendar year (January 1st - December 31st) depending on tenure, performance, company need for the learned skill, and available budget. A course/program is considered to be included in the calendar year in which the course/program is paid/reimbursed (which should also be the same calendar year in which it ends). If a course/program ends in December, team members have a grace period until the end of January to claim for Growth & Development reimbursements from the previous calendar year.

Budget estimations for the Growth & Development Fund are based on utilization rates from past years, adjusted for the size of the company. The budget is managed on a company-wide scale, not division-specific. For example, approving reimbursement for a team member in Engineering does not “take away” budget from other engineers. Eligibility is managed on an individual basis. Eligibility for the fund is part of each GitLab team member’s Total Rewards package.

The Growth and Development fund is managed by the [Learning and Development team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/#learning--development-team). For any questions, please contact a team member directly, or reach out in the #learninganddevelopment slack channel.

## Growth and Development Fund Eligibility

To be eligible for the Growth and Development Fund, you must meet the following criteria:

- Team members who are full-time and have been employed for three months can participate in this fund.
- If you are a part-time GitLab team member, you may still be eligible to participate in this fund but your reimbursement might be reduced.
- Team members who are currently on "leave" status will not be eligible to use the growth and development fund.
- Team members who are meeting performance expectations in their current role. (Should not be on a Performance Improvement Plan, or receiving remedial coaching regarding underperformance)

## How to Apply for the Growth and Development Fund

Here is a step by step guide on G&D applications:

**Step 1:** Have a [career development conversation](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#what-is-career-development) with your manager to discuss the learning opportunity. It's important to discuss timing, team member capacity, and application timeline for both the program and fund processing. This conversation should allow time for you to apply for the program and your manager to ensure team capacity.

**Step 2:** Create a new Growth & Development issue using one of the issue templates below. Please create your issue within the notification timeframe set out below.

|G&D Issue Template|Notification Timeframe|
|------------------|----------------------|
|[Academic Study](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/growth-and-development-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=g-and-d-academic-study)|30 days before the commencement date|
|[Conference](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/growth-and-development-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=g-and-d-conference)|30 days before the commencement date|
|[Other G&D Types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/growth-and-development-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=g-and-d-other)|7 days before the commencement date|
|[Coaching Right Now (GitLab's coaching vendor of choice)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/growth-and-development-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=g-and-d-coaching) Learn more about Coaching Right Now below. | 30 days before the commencement date|
| Your 4th Trimester | For Your 4th Trimester applications, please notify Talent Development that you would like to participate in the program by sending an email to `growth-development@gitlab.com`. |

The application process is visible internally. If there is any reason that you would like to keep your application confidential, please send `growth-development@gitlab.com` an email with the details of your application (refer to the issue templates for the information required).

**Step 3:** Request approval on the issue. Depending on the cost of the application, different approval levels are required. In all instances, your direct manager should be the first approver in the issue.

Cost Tiers Approval:
- Manager Approval (with VP's made aware on the issue): $0-$1,000
- Manager + VP Approval: $1,000.01 - $5,000
- Manager + eGroup Approval for any spend $5,000.01 - $10,000 (Apart from Sales, where VPs can approve $5,000.01 - $10,000 spend)

Once the manager has approved, there is no further action to be taken by the manager. They can unassign themselves to the issue if they wish.

**Step 4:** Claim for reimbursement:

Once the appropriate approvals are provided on the Growth and Development issue, proceed with processing your G&D application. **You do not have to wait for approval or further action from the Learning and Development team.**

Before attempting to claim reimbursement, please ensure you've read through and understand the [Notes on Reimbursement](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#notes-on-reimbursement) section below.

- Claim your expenses via [Navan Expense](/handbook/finance/expenses/#-introduction):
  - In your Navan Expense report, choose the Expense type `G&D (Growth and Development)`.
  - Include a screenshot of your approved Growth & Development issue & add a link to the issue to the description.
    - If reimbursing for an Academic or Course/Certificate program, include a screenshot of your final grade report/transcript/certificate (see)
  - Please make sure the issue matches your Navan Expense claim amount. Your Navan Expense claim will be audited against the Growth & Development issue amount.
- Please claim conference and workshop meals and lodging per receipt via [Navan Expense](/handbook/finance/expenses/#-introduction).

You may close the issue once you have received reimbursement for the program.

### Notes on Reimbursement

Growth & Development requests are a reimbursed expense and follow a reimbursement workflow. Approved experiences will be reimbursed upon completion. This means requestors carry the financial responsibility associated with the growth experience through completion.

As an option, requests over $1,000 USD can take advantage of the split disbursement option designed to help team members carry the financial lift of costly experiences. The split disbursement option allows for 50% of the costs to be reimbursed immediately after payment and the remaining 50% is reimbursed upon completion.

Here’s how this workflow works:

1. After all necessary approvals, the requesting team member pays for the approved G&D experience.
1. If costs for this G&D experience exceed $1000USD, the team member can submit the proof of payment (via Navan), and the approved GitLab issue to receive a reimbursement of 50% of the total costs.  When submitting in Navan, please state explicitly in the `Description` section of your expense claim that this is for a 50% reimbursement, with a link to your approved G&D issue.
1. Upon completion, the team member will submit the proof of completion (certificate, completion email, etc.) along with that same approved issue to receive the remaining 50% of total costs.

### Recoupment of Growth and Development Reimbursements

If you voluntarily terminate employment with GitLab prior to completing twelve consecutive months of active employment, academic study or tuition expenses of $1,000 USD and over will need to be refunded to GitLab.

## Bulk Applications

- If multiple team members are doing the same training or attending the same conference, please open one issue.
- Each team member should pay for their own expenses and process their own reimbursement through Navan. Team Members or Managers should not cover the expenses of other team members, as any reimbursements will count against their Growth and Development allowance.

## Company-directed Learning Opportunities

The Growth and Development policy is meant to further team members' learning and growth. Company-directed learning opportunities, such as mandatory conferences or training that are required to fulfill their job duties, are not within the scope of the Growth and Development policy and should be budgeted for outside the policy. Such expenses will not be deducted from the team member's annual Growth and Development limit and should be paid for by GitLab rather than reimbursed to the team member.

### Tax Implications

In some countries, the Growth and Development Fund may be considered as taxable income and can be (partially) exempted from personal income taxes or subject to employer withholding taxes. Check [the tax table]({{< ref "tax" >}}) for any tax implications in your country.

For example, in the United States 2021 tax year, if GitLab pays over [$5,250 for educational benefits for you during the year, you must generally pay tax on the amount over $5,250](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center). GitLab should include in your wages (Form W-2, box 1) the amount over $5,250 in income.

Please contact [Payroll](mailto:payroll@gitlab.com) for any tax-related questions in your country.
