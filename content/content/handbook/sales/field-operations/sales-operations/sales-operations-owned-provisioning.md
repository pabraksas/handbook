### Sales Operations Provisioning Workflow

### Baseline Templates | New Hires

1. The templates will automatically:
   - Add the SalesOpsAR::Action Needed label
   - Leave the assignee blank
   - CC Amber and Meri as the Provisioning DRIs
1.  The DRIs will receive an email when a new AR is created
1.  All will be able to monitor the [Sales Ops Access Request Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/boards/1959331)proactively.
1.  When the AR is picked up by the Sales Operations team member, the team member will:
    - assign the issue to themself
    - add the label SaelsOpsAR::In Progress
1.  The Assignee should be responsible for working the AR to completion by completing all Sales Operations task items and working the label system accordingly.
1.  If Assignee is out of office, the rest of the team is responsible for moving the AR forward in a timely fashion and can see ARs in flight by looking at the [Sales Ops Access Request Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/boards/1959331)proactively.
