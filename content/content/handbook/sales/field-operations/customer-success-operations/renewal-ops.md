## Who We Work With

Renewal Operations supports the Renewals, Success and Sales Teams: Directors & Area Sales Managers, Renewals Managers, Account Executives, Strategic Account Executives and collaborates with Customer Success Operations, Sales Operations and Sales Strategy.

[**Renewals Team**](/handbook/customer-success/renewals-managers/home/) is Renewal Operationsâ€™ direct focus, our primary customers are Renewals leaders; the insights, strategies, and actionable campaigns are built to assist the Renewal Managers and Account Executives with the renewal process.  Renewals Operations provides intelligent insights for the large amount of upcoming renewals managed by Account Teams to allow a more focused approach.

**Customer Success Operations** helps organize and collect pertinent product usage, and  customer health data that the Renewal Operations Team uses to identify insights and engagement strategies. For example, creating automated one-to-many campaigns in Gainsight to support product adoption.

**Sales Operations** supports Renewal Operations by maintaining our systems that process the renewals and opportunity management. As we progress, it can also improve risk management and forecasting.
