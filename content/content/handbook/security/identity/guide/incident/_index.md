title: "Identity User Guide - Incident Response"
description: "The Identity Platform manages the top-level of administrative access and infrastructure for GitLab systems access, and manages access policies for our tech stack applications. We manage all configuration using Terraform or REST API for base state management with a GitOps CI/CD approach. We use YAML files for day-to-day user, group and policy management. This page provides a quick reference guide and runbooks for Security Operations team members to respond to incidents and self service guide for frequently asked questions and use cases."
