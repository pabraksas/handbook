## Overview

By default, [trial licenses do not include support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/#trials-support).

As a member of the Sales/CS team, if you have a prospect who wishes to have access to GitLab Customer Support as part of their trial or Proof of Value, you can request temporary support for their trial license. This program is for strategically important prospects, and eligibility must be considered by Sales leadership. Generally, prospects with potential ARR of less than $100,000 are not be likely to be approved.

**NOTE:** This option is solely for **prospects** where the account type in Salesforce is `Prospect`. This cannot be applied to any type of account other than `Prospect`. For any other account, please see our main handbook page on [Requesting Gratis Support](/handbook/support/gratis-support/).

  Any others will be rejected by the system, and the tickets automatically closed.
- All tickets must specify "Sales Assisted Trial" in the "Tell us about your GitLab
  subscription" field. Any other option can cause routing problems.

  [this form](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=334447),
  unless it is specifically about SaaS Account related matters
