description: Workflow for an ASE when their account submits an emergency
---

An account with an Assigned Support Engineer (ASE) can submit an emergency
either [while you're available](#when-available)
or [when you're not](#when-unavailable).

In either case, it is important to note that you are not permanently on-call
and, thus, are **not required** to take the emergency unless you're the on-call
engineer. However, at times like these it is important to remember
that you are the Support Engineer with the most context of the
customer's situation, problems, & objectives, and might be able to save several hours of
troubleshooting during this emergency scenario.

## Process for the on-call engineer

Regardless of when it comes in, the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals.html)
for the emergency continues to be the on-call Support Engineer.
Their only process change is that they should **notify the ASE when
their account submits an emergency**.
This can be done by pinging the ASE's Slack handle in the Slack thread where the
emergency is being discussed.

Once an emergency comes in, the on-call engineer creates its Slack thread,
and notifies the ASE of what's going on, then the on-call engineer can continue
working with the customer as they would any other.

## Process for the ASE

### When available

If the on-call engineer notifies you of an emergency and you are either
available or can be available, then work alongside the on-call engineer to
resolve the ticket. This may involve *any* of the following:

- Taking over as
  [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals.html) for the emergency
- Shadowing the emergency for any amount of time
- Troubleshooting the emergency in Slack, asynchronously
- Updating the on-call engineer with any required context

Any help you can provide will be appreciated.

### When unavailable

If you come back to work and see that an emergency took place while you
weren't available, then catch up on what happened and reach out to the
customer to discuss any next steps.

If a big task is planned while you know you'll be unavailable
[be proactive](#be-proactive) and prepare the on-call engineer.

### Be proactive

If a task is planned after-hours that may lead to an emergency (an upcoming upgrade,
migration, etc.) then it would be useful to create a summary
of what's planned, possible problems that could arise (if you know any), and suggested solutions.
If you have other account-specific information that the on-call SE might need
while troubleshooting (architecture info, problems, etc.), please put it into
an internal note in the
existing ticket leading up to the task so the on-call engineer can see it.
